CIS 3368 Final Project Repository

This is the Github Repository for Zheng Bok Chia and Aaron Stockman's CIS 3368 Final Project Submission.

Video presentation of the code and functionality is done via Microsoft Streams and can be accessed via this link: https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/d8aaf0ab-141d-4ba7-8c06-196afc875bb3

Our project utilizes Spring Boot to create a web application.
The web application gets data from a public COVID-19 API (url:https://api.quarantine.country/api/v1/summary/latest) and displays it onto the webpage.
A table hosted via AWS Educate MYSQL database is also present. It can save and display previously saved data called from the API.

Our web app has three different scenes, one for login, one for api data and table and one for the graphs.
The graph data is pulled directly from the table implemented underneath the graph via Javascript. 
CSS styling is used to give a nicer and smoother appearance to the application. 

The document detailing more about the project and information regarding work distribution and implementation has been uploaded to Blackboard 24 hours prior.
